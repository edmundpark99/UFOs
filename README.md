**UFO Challenge**

*Purpose of the Analysis*

The ultimate goal of this particular project was to create a webpage that provides an in-depth look at UFO sightings over the years. We had created an HTML page for this beforehand, but edited the page to filter for different criteria at the same time, such as date, city, shape, country, state, and vice versa. The webpage was created using the pre-established HTML page that was created over the course of the module, as well as an app.js file with a data.js file as well. Through this, a functional webpage to look at UFO-signtings had been formed.

*Results*

The webpage immediately filters based on verious criteria.

You can type in various criteria, and it'll produce a variety of results. Each category has a distinct delineation of criteria, such as date, city, location, country, shape of UFO, and vice versa. Typing in these criteria will filter out the data presented based on the criteria that is placed in.

*Summary*

One drawback of this design is that it is using a variety of separate data criteria as filters from a relatively large set of data. Two further devlopments that would be useful are the development of a cleaner user interface that identifies certain criteria discretely, especially for dates in different forms, as well as case sensitivity. Moreover, a way to catch multiple words in a filter criteria would be a useful development for the future as well.
